      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong&gt;Karanveer Singh&lt;/strong&gt;, and welcome to my DevLog! This is my space where I share my journey through the fascinating world of IT, cybersecurity, ethical hacking, Linux, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I first tinkered with computers, I&amp;rsquo;ve been captivated by how technology worksâ€”from building systems from scratch to understanding the intricate details of digital security. My passion for cybersecurity has driven me to explore ethical hacking and system administration, and now I want to bring you along on that journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;i just spent my whole sunday on getting this working and i am tired now because most of the tutorials i had followed were for macos or were just outdated. the biggest issue with deploying to github pages is that github pages looks for stylesheet links in a html file the different way and hugo was not doing that, so i had to look for a solutions for hours and now i finally have it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
